ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT

General Description
Our project is a simple prototype of a pet feeder using Arduino Uno. With the help of sensors and the servo  motor which with the help of angle measurement rotates the lid of the container ,from which the food drops down for a certain amount of time and then rotates back to close it.

The model comprises of  three primary sensors –
1)	Passive Infrared Sensor(PIR) 
2)	Ultrasonic Sensor
3)	Light Sensor 


Functions of the Sensors

1)	PIR sensor or PIR motion sensor is the kind of pyroelectric IR sensor that measures the Infrared radiations released from objects and thus identify them as moving or still objects. PIR Modules have 3 pins , One pin will be ground, another will be signal and the final one will be power. It helps us to detect the pet movements .


2)	 An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic sensors are used primarily as proximity. It has 4 pins , VCC,GND ,Trig and Echo.It detects the distance of the food level in the container .

3) Light Sensors are photoelectric devices that convert light energy (photons)  whether visible or infra-red light into an electrical (electrons) signal. It generates an output signal indicating the intensity of light by measuring the radiant energy that exists in a very narrow range of frequencies basically called “light”. It detects whether its light(day) or dark(night) , to control food portion .
